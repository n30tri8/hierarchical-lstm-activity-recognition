# A Hierarchical LSTM for Volleyball Group Activity Recognition

This is a re-implementation of the paper below. 
The re-implementation is in TensorFlow and there are some modifications w.r.t. the original paper.
I have also included my presentation in which I described my motivation for re-implementation and the results.

Important: 
The last part of model and training is yet to be completed.
There are TODOs annotated in the `main.ipynb`.

### Description of two files:
- `main.ipynb`: The main code in notebook format.
- `hierarchical-lstm/training.py`: For training the code without notebook text cells, intended as a clone of `main.ipynb`. This file is incomplete and was not presented.
